### Schema Requirements

The schema for our core entity/entities should include, at a minimum, the following fields:

- `name` or `title`: A name or title for the entity.
- `description`: A brief or detailed description of the entity.
- `createdBy`: A reference to the user who created the entity.
- `createdAt`: A timestamp to record when the entity was created.
- [Add any additional fields or features specific to your application's requirements.]

Your task is to define the schema for the core entity/entities in a way that supports real-time interactions within our application.

### Example Schema (Mongoose)

Here's an example of how you can define the schema for the core entity/entities using Mongoose in your Node.js application:
